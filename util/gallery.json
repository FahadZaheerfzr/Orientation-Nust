There’s never a silent moment to be found in this department, where the very courtyard itself acts as a stage for all the students.

These students come from multiple backgrounds and thus to help groom them, societies have been created. At present, 35+ societies are working in NUST, with a majority being open to students of all schools. These are student-run societies and receive funding from either external sponsors or the Main Office. These societies will have stalls up and you will be shown an introductory message of all societies and their workings during Orientation and while they may seem too many in number to remember and keep count and may either excite or even overwhelm you, it is important to know what you want to do. Societies are a way of grooming yourself, your personality, and your skills, all the while making new friends and lots of good memories. Some well-known societies include NUST Community Service Club (NCSC), NUST Debating Society (NDS), NUST Trekking Club (NTC), NUST Dramatics Club (NDC), and NUST Media Club (NMC). Applications for executives generally start after a couple of weeks of the induction of the freshmen batch. There are multiple portfolios in each society and inside each portfolio, the hierarchy followed is: Executives -> Deputy Director(s) -> Director. When filling the forms, be sure to be truthful but confident and give the interview with even greater confidence. Societies are not only a way of personal and professional grooming, but also a way of networking. So be open and nice to all and make new friends! Choose whichever portfolio interests you the most and apply away!"

With the campus being closed and shifting to online mode for almost a year and a half, university life is back to full zeal and zest and everyone is buzzing with excitement and ideas. Multiple societies and schools arrange different types of events, with different scales and thus it is good to keep an eye open. Some common types of social events are hiking trips to any northern area. These include night stay trips too. Other events include bake sales and movie screenings, scavenger hunts, global villages, and sports galas, concerts, raves, and talks and activities. Each comes with a ticket price ranging from Rs. 100 – Rs. 2500. It is important that you go to these events and make new friends and memories. These 4 years of your life are the best years, do not lose track of your path but also do enjoy and make the most of this time!"

      "content": "In university, you take classes from 9 am to 5 pm for the first time in your life. This not only tires you but also increases your need to refuel yourself. In addition to this, long and dreary lectures can also make us hungry, just to have an excuse to get through the class. With the huge and gorgeous campus, you walk around a lot and want to spend time with friends and be social and just have a good time. The words friends and fun go hand-in-hand with food and NUST makes sure you have no fewer food options. With the 4 main cafeterias and the 4 other fancy-dhaba-style cafes, which are student-run, food options are plenty. Starting with the main cafeterias, Concordia 1 (C1) and Concordia 2 (C2). These are proper big circular structures with everything from food shops to stationery and tuck shops. Both these cafeterias offer a variety of food items ranging from sandwiches and fries to chana daal and biryani. Some of the more loved items are Samosa Chaat and Biryani from C1, Roll parathas from C2. Fries are best left to café in C2 or Margalla café, opposite SADA Parking. C1 is generally crowded with students of SADA, ASAB, NBS, and SCME whereas C2 is comparatively less crowded, with students of SEECS and other schools mostly going there. Concordia 3 (C3), right opposite to Library, and Concordia 4 (C4), in SMME, are famous for their desi breakfast and biryani and orange juice in winter. C3 is generally alive at night, with the lights on and the pretty view of the sports complex. C4 is mostly limited to students of SNS and SMME, who are closest to it and farthest from all other cafes. Another option is the NICE rooftop café, famous for its shawarmas. Coming to the student-run cafes, the two open these days are Margalla, opposite SADA parking, and Retro, near the Boy’s hostels. With the other two cafes closed, Margalla is the life of NUST, and their food is equally so. Everything on their menu, from the fries to the pizza, everything is of great taste and quality, with the cheesy pasta being a student favorite. The first semester after coming to NUST is just exploring, do not hesitate to try new things and be open to experimenting and seeing for yourself what you like, and don’t forget to make some good memories while doing so! \uD83D\uDE0A"
